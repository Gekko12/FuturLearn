          <h3>About this course</h3>
          <p>Do you realize that the only functionality of a web application that the user directly interacts with is
            through the web page? Implement it poorly and, to the user, the server-side becomes irrelevant! Today’s user
            expects a lot out of the web page: it has to load fast, expose the desired service, and be comfortable to
            view on all devices: from a desktop computers to tablets and mobile phones. <br><br>
            In this course, we will learn the basic tools that every web page coder needs to know. We will start from
            the ground up by learning how to implement modern web pages with HTML and CSS. We will then advance to
            learning how to code our pages such that its components rearrange and resize themselves automatically based
            on the size of the user’s screen. You’ll be able to code up a web page that will be just as useful on a
            mobile phone as on a desktop computer. No “pinch and zoom” required!</p>

          <h3>About this course</h3>
          <p>In this Specialization, you will learn industry-standard theory and methods for developing successful user
            interfaces (UIs). Upon completing this Specialization, you will have fluency with the user research,
            prototyping and evaluation techniques necessary for creating intuitive interfaces that facilitate good user
            experiences. You will also have demonstrated this fluency through an in-depth Capstone Project that can be
            shown to prospective employers in the fast-growing field of UI design.<br><br>
            Concepts and techniques covered include structured approaches for helping you understand your user base and
            their needs (e.g. contextual inquiry and design psychology), widely-employed prototyping and design methods
            (e.g. low-fidelity and paper prototyping), and robust techniques for helping you evaluate your design
            choices (e.g. heuristic evaluation and user studies). By the end of the Specialization, you will be
            comfortable applying these concepts and techniques to design an interface for a wide variety of users from
            around the world.</p>

          <h3>About this course</h3>
          <p>This course deals with all things server-side. We base the entire course around the NodeJS platform. We
            start with a brief overview of the Web protocols: HTTP and HTTPS. We examine NodeJS and NodeJS modules:
            Express for building web servers.<br><br>
            Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8
            engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Node.js is an open source server
            environment. Node.js is free. Node.js runs on various platforms (Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac OS X,
            etc.). Node.js uses JavaScript on the server. Node.js uses asynchronous programming! Node.js runs
            single-threaded, non-blocking, asynchronously programming, which is very memory efficient.Node.js can
            generate dynamic page content. Node.js can create, open, read, write, delete, and close files on the
            server. Node.js can collect form data. Node.js can add, delete, modify data in your database. Node.js files
            contain tasks that will be executed on certain events. A typical event is someone trying to access a port
            on the server. Node.js files must be initiated on the server before having any effect. Node.js files have
            extension ".js"</p>

          <h3>About this course</h3>
          <p>This course introduces the programming language JavaScript and shows the websites that include the type of
            interactions students will eventually be able to develop. Learners will understand the importance of how
            JavaScript was developed and why such history impacts the way JavaScript is currently written and in future
            releases.<br><br>
            Learners will write their first scripts, have their HTML and CSS skills assessed, create variables and
            arrays and assign values to them. If student’s skills are lacking, resources and recommendations are
            provided to improve these skills. There is ample opportunity for students to practice these first, core
            skills.</p>
